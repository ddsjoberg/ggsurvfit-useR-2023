# Basic Example

::: columns
::: {.column width="80%"}

```{r}
survfit2(Surv(time, status) ~ surg, data = df_colon) |> 
  ggsurvfit() +
  add_risktable()
```

:::
::: {.column width="20%"}
::: {.smaller}
::: {.incremental}

* The Good
  - Simple code and figure is nearly publishable
  - Risk table with both no. at risk and events easily added
  - x-axis label taken from the `time` column label
  - Can use **ggplot2** `+` notation

  
* The Could-Be-Better
  - y-axis label is incorrect, and the range of axis is best at 0-100%
  - Axis padding a bit more than I prefer for a KM figure
  - x-axis typically has more tick marks for KM figure

# Basic Example

::: columns
::: {.column width="80%"}
```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "4-5"
survfit2(Surv(time, status) ~ surg, data = df_colon) |> 
  ggsurvfit() +
  add_risktable() +
  scale_ggsurvfit() +
  labs(y = "Recurrence-free Progression")
```

:::
::: {.column width="20%"}
::: {.smaller}
::: {.incremental}

* Padding has been reduced and curves begin in the upper left corner of plot

* x-axis reports additional time points (and as a result, the risk table as well)

* We updated the y-axis label weaving standard **ggplot2** functions

* Padding has been reduced and curves begin in the upper left corner of plot

* x-axis reports additional time points (and as a result, the risk table as well)

* We updated the y-axis label weaving standard **ggplot2** functions

* We can even use ggplot2-extender functions
