## A widely used statistical summary 

::: {.smaller}

Time-to-event (a.k.a Survival or Kaplan-Meier) summaries are commonplace, from oncology to cardiovascular. 

KM displays the estimated cumulative proportion over time of patients who survive (or report an event)

However, it was not such a simple start:

John Tukey insisted Edward L. Kaplan and Paul Meier combine their efforts after submitting independent papers to JASA, which took 4 more years for the authors of the “KM” estimator to publish

Afterwards “Paul Meier himself is said to have spoken with bemusement about people plotting KM estimates over time and was not convinced he actually liked it” [Morris et al, 2018]( https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/9/e030215)

:::

```{r}
library(survival)
fit <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ surg, data = df_colon) 
plot(fit)
```


## Can we do better? 

::: {.smaller}

There are many design and analytical choices to be made when designing even a simple KM plot – these choices can lead to wide variation in presentation quality.

:::

```{r}
library(ggsurvfit)
fit2 <- survfit2(Surv(time, status) ~ surg, data = df_colon) 
ggsurvfit(fit2) 
```
