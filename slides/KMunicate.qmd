## What are the elements of an effective and publishable KM plot? 

There are many options to consider and many guidances available:

::: {.smaller}

* [Morris et al. 2018](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/9/e030215) provide useful guidance for publication figures

* To get figures that align with **KMunicate** use the `theme_ggsurvfit_KMunicate()` theme along with these function options.

:::

A note of caution on standards: 

::: {.smaller}

* Design for your purpose, one size does not fit all

* Designing means you need to think carefully about your [audience and aims](http://graphicsprinciples.github.io/)
